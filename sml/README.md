# SML (MLton)

Author: Sofia (https://github.com/srdqty)

## Compile

If you have mlton installed, you can just run make and the resulting
executable will be named `unscientific`.

## TODO

The current version is based on the haskell version. Perhaps I could tweek it
to be faster.

On my machine, I get 0.614s for the SML version and 0.729s for the Haskell
version.
